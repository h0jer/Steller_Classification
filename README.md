Stellar Classification Dataset

We selected a stellar classification dataset compiled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which analyzed over 100,000 interstellar phenomena categorized as stars, galaxies, or qso. Here are some key points about the dataset:

Column Identifiers and Meanings
Alpha (Right Ascension Angle): Represents the celestial longitude of the object.
Delta (Declination Angle): Indicates the celestial latitude of the object.
Filters: Visualized the filters used to observe the objects based on the type of light they emit. These filters included ultraviolet, green, red, infrared, and near-infrared.
Redshift (z): Quasars exhibit the highest redshift (approximately 1.7), followed by galaxies (approximately 0.42), while stars have essentially zero redshift.
Analysis
We applied deep learning model (ANN) to predict stellar classifications. Here are the results:

Neural Networks: Intermediate accuracy (average accuracy of 97.0%).
Our goal was to understand which variables are most important in determining/classifying objects as stars, galaxies, or qso. We hope this dataset and analysis contribute to the fascinating field of astronomy!
